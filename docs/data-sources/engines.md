# Data Source: filess_engines



The `filess_engines` data source allows you to retrieve information about available database engines on the filess.io platform.

## Example Usage

### List All Available Engines

```hcl
data "filess_engines" "all" {}

output "available_engines" {
  value = data.filess_engines.all.engines
}
```

### Filter MySQL 8.0

```hcl
data "filess_engines" "all" {}

locals {
  mysql_8 = [
    for engine in data.filess_engines.all.engines :
    engine if engine.name == "MySQL" && engine.version == "8.0"
  ][0]
}

resource "filess_database" "example" {
  # ...
  engine_id = local.mysql_8.id
}
```

### Filter by Engine Name

```hcl
data "filess_engines" "all" {}

locals {
  postgres_engines = [
    for engine in data.filess_engines.all.engines :
    engine if engine.name == "PostgreSQL"
  ]
  
  mariadb_engines = [
    for engine in data.filess_engines.all.engines :
    engine if engine.name == "MariaDB"
  ]
  
  mongodb_engines = [
    for engine in data.filess_engines.all.engines :
    engine if engine.name == "MongoDB"
  ]
}

output "postgres_versions" {
  value = [for e in local.postgres_engines : e.version]
}
```

### Get Latest Version

```hcl
data "filess_engines" "all" {}

locals {
  mysql_engines = [
    for engine in data.filess_engines.all.engines :
    engine if engine.name == "MySQL" && engine.active
  ]
  
  # Sort by version and get the latest (simple string comparison)
  latest_mysql = reverse(sort([
    for engine in local.mysql_engines : engine.version
  ]))[0]
  
  latest_mysql_engine = [
    for engine in local.mysql_engines :
    engine if engine.version == local.latest_mysql
  ][0]
}

output "latest_mysql_id" {
  value = local.latest_mysql_engine.id
}
```

## Schema

### Read-Only

- `engines` (List of Object) List of available database engines (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--engines))
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--engines"></a>
### Nested Schema for `engines`

Read-Only:

- `active` (Boolean)
- `id` (String)
- `name` (String)
- `slug` (String)
- `version` (String)

## Available Engines

Common database engines available on filess.io include:

- **MySQL** - Popular open-source relational database
- **PostgreSQL** - Advanced open-source relational database
- **MariaDB** - MySQL fork with additional features
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL document database
- **Redis** - In-memory data structure store
- **And more...**

## Attributes Reference

Each engine in the `engines` list contains:

- `id` - Unique identifier for the engine (use this in `filess_database.engine_id`)
- `name` - Human-readable engine name (e.g., "MySQL", "PostgreSQL")
- `version` - Engine version (e.g., "8.0", "15.2")
- `slug` - URL-friendly engine identifier
- `description` - Detailed description of the engine
- `image` - URL to the engine's logo/icon
- `active` - Boolean indicating if the engine is currently available

## Notes

- The list of engines is cached for the duration of the Terraform run
- Only active engines (`active = true`) should be used for new databases
- Engine IDs are stable and won't change
- Different versions of the same engine have different IDs
